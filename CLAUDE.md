## Rules to abide in development
- The whole landing page must be made of just HTML and CSS
- Animations are required to make the site look completely modern. I'll leave it to your descretion to decide what kind of animation.
- The entire site must be mobile responsive. This is a MUST HAVE.
- Ensure you use the images provided to understand the colors and font usage.
- Background color is Off White.
- Remove complete backend and make the codebase optimized for Github pages.
